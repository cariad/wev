# wev: with environment variables

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/cariad/wev/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=MJ4M989DEX)](https://codecov.io/gh/cariad/wev)

`wev` is a cross-platform command line tool for resolving temporary environment variables.

For example:

- `wev` can [create a multi-factor authenticated Amazon Web Services session](https://wevcli.app/examples/aws-mfa-on-command-line).
- `wev` can [set Amazon Web Services named profiles per-project](https://wevcli.app/examples/aws-profile-per-project).

My name is **Cariad**, and I'm an [independent freelance DevOps engineer](https://cariad.me).

I'd love to spend more time working on projects like this, but--as a freelancer--my income is sporadic and I need to chase gigs that pay the rent.

If this project has value to you, please consider [‚òïÔ∏è sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/cariad) me. Sponsorships grant me time to work on _your_ wants rather than _someone else's_.

Thank you! ‚ù§Ô∏è
